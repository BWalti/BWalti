### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer based in ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­, love working on dotnet, cloud and DevOps things.
I am interested in a lot of different things from frontend (vue.js) to backend (dotnet) using funny things like Microsoft Orleans, running them on my own Rancher k3s cluster, playing with raspbery pi's, ESP32, ... and I also like to mountainbike from time to time :)
